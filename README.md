- Hi, I’m Cornelius or CJ for short.
- I’m interested in anything tech related to transition into the industry and make a career for myself.
- I’m currently re-learning to code, I am comfortable using Javascript, C++, as well as MIPS.
- I’m looking to collaborate on small projects to gain experience and rebuild core concepts (re-teaching myself to code).
- 📫 How to reach me ... @c0rnelius__ on Discord
