- 👋 Hi, I’m @corneliusSW20 or CJ for short.
- 👀 I’m interested in anything tech related to transition into the industry and make a career for myself.
- 🌱 I’m currently re-learning to code, I am comfortable using Javascript, C++, as well as MIPS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small projects to gain experience and rebuild core concepts (re-teaching myself to code).
- 📫 How to reach me ... @corneliusdeary@gmail.com
